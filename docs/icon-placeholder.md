# SchemaMagic Package Icon

This directory contains the package icon for SchemaMagic NuGet package.

The icon should be:
- 128x128 pixels minimum
- PNG format
- Transparent background preferred
- Should represent database schema visualization

For now, a placeholder icon reference is included in the project file. 
The actual icon file `icon.png` should be created and placed in this directory.
