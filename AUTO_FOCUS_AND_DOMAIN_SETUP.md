# Auto-Focus and Custom Domain Setup - Complete ?

## Summary
Successfully implemented auto-focus on the repository input field and created comprehensive documentation for setting up the custom domain `schema.magicsuite.net`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Auto-Focus on Repository Input Field

#### JavaScript Function Added (app.js)
```javascript
window.setRepositoryInputFocus = () => {
    const repoInput = document.getElementById('repoUrl');
    if (repoInput) {
        repoInput.focus();
    }
};
```

#### Blazor Component Updated (Home.razor)
Added `OnAfterRenderAsync` lifecycle method:
```csharp
protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)
{
    if (firstRender)
    {
        // Set focus on the repository input field
        await JSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync("setRepositoryInputFocus");
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ? Improved user experience - users can start typing immediately
- ? Reduced clicks - no need to manually click the input field
- ? Accessibility - proper focus management
- ? Only runs on first render - no performance impact

### 2. CNAME File Created

Created `SchemaMagic.Web/wwwroot/CNAME`:
```
schema.magicsuite.net
```

This file will be included in the published output and tells GitHub Pages which custom domain to use.

### 3. Comprehensive DNS Setup Guide

Created `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_SETUP.md` with complete instructions covering:

#### DNS Configuration
- **CNAME Record** (Recommended): `schema ? panoramicdata.github.io`
- **A Records** (Alternative): GitHub's IP addresses
- Provider-specific instructions (Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Route53, Namecheap)

#### GitHub Pages Configuration
- Custom domain setup in repository settings
- HTTPS enablement
- SSL certificate provisioning

#### Verification Steps
- DNS propagation checking
- GitHub Pages status verification
- Website accessibility testing

#### Troubleshooting
- DNS check unsuccessful
- CNAME conflicts
- 404 errors
- Certificate provisioning issues
- Cloudflare redirect loops

#### Additional Information
- DNS cache clearing commands
- File structure requirements
- GitHub Actions workflow example
- Security considerations
- Timeline expectations

## Implementation Steps for Custom Domain

### Step 1: Configure DNS (Your DNS Provider)

Add this CNAME record:
```
Type:  CNAME
Name:  schema
Value: panoramicdata.github.io
TTL:   Auto or 3600
```

**Important for Cloudflare users:** Set to "DNS only" mode (gray cloud), not proxied.

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to: `https://github.com/panoramicdata/SchemaMagic/settings/pages`
2. Under "Custom domain", enter: `schema.magicsuite.net`
3. Click **Save**
4. Wait for DNS check to complete
5. Enable **Enforce HTTPS** after DNS propagates

### Step 3: Deploy with CNAME File

The CNAME file is already created in `SchemaMagic.Web/wwwroot/CNAME`. 

When you publish the Blazor WebAssembly app, this file will be included in the output and deployed to GitHub Pages automatically.

### Step 4: Wait for Propagation

- **DNS propagation:** 5 minutes to 48 hours
- **SSL certificate:** 15 minutes to 24 hours after DNS
- **Total time:** Typically 1-4 hours, max 48 hours

### Step 5: Verify

Check these URLs:
```
http://schema.magicsuite.net
https://schema.magicsuite.net
```

Both should work, with HTTP redirecting to HTTPS.

## Auto-Focus Behavior

### User Experience Flow

1. **Page Loads** ? User sees hero section with analyzer form
2. **Components Render** ? Blazor completes initial render
3. **OnAfterRenderAsync Fires** ? First render detected
4. **Focus Set** ? Repository input field receives focus automatically
5. **User Can Type** ? Immediate keyboard input without clicking

### Technical Implementation

```
Browser Load
    ?
Blazor WebAssembly Initialization
    ?
Home Component Rendered
    ?
OnAfterRenderAsync(firstRender: true)
    ?
JSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync("setRepositoryInputFocus")
    ?
JavaScript: document.getElementById('repoUrl').focus()
    ?
Input Field Focused ?
```

## Testing Checklist

## DNS Record Summary

### What You Need to Add

**If using Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Route53, Namecheap, etc.:**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Record Type** | CNAME |
| **Name/Host** | schema |
| **Value/Target** | panoramicdata.github.io |
| **TTL** | Auto or 3600 |
| **Proxy** | DNS only (if Cloudflare) |

### What This Does

```
schema.magicsuite.net
    ? (CNAME points to)
panoramicdata.github.io
    ? (GitHub Pages resolves to)
Your Published SchemaMagic.Web Site
```

## Expected Timeline

| Task | Time Required |
|------|---------------|
| **Code changes** | ? Complete |
| **CNAME file** | ? Complete |
| **Add DNS record** | 5 minutes (your action) |
| **DNS propagation** | 5 min - 48 hours (automatic) |
| **Configure GitHub Pages** | 5 minutes (your action) |
| **GitHub DNS check** | 5-15 minutes (automatic) |
| **SSL certificate** | 15 min - 24 hours (automatic) |
| **Full availability** | **Total: 1-48 hours** |

## Quick Start Commands

### Check DNS Propagation
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
nslookup schema.magicsuite.net

# Expected output should include:
# Name: panoramicdata.github.io
```

### Online Tools
- DNS Propagation: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#CNAME/schema.magicsuite.net
- SSL Test: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/

## Support & Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **DNS not resolving:**
   - Wait longer (up to 48 hours)
   - Verify DNS record is correct
   - Clear your DNS cache
   - Test from different locations/devices

2. **GitHub DNS check fails:**
   - Verify DNS is fully propagated first
   - Check for typos in DNS record
   - Ensure no conflicting DNS records
   - Remove and re-add custom domain in GitHub

3. **SSL certificate issues:**
   - Ensure DNS is working first
   - Wait 24 hours after DNS propagates
   - Try disabling and re-enabling HTTPS
   - Check if CAA records block Let's Encrypt

4. **Cloudflare specific:**
   - Set to "DNS only" mode (gray cloud)
   - Or set SSL/TLS to "Full" mode
   - Disable "Always Use HTTPS" in Cloudflare
   - Let GitHub Pages handle HTTPS

## Conclusion

**Auto-Focus Implementation:** ? Complete and ready to use

**Custom Domain Setup:** 
- ? Code changes complete
- ? CNAME file created
- ? Documentation provided
- ? Waiting for user to add DNS record
- ? Waiting for DNS propagation
- ? Waiting for GitHub Pages configuration

The auto-focus feature will work immediately after deployment. The custom domain will work once you complete the DNS configuration and GitHub Pages setup as described in the comprehensive guide.
